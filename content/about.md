# Hi there

My name is Fredrik and this is my blog. I work in Software Development and spend most of time either behind the monitor or in the woods.

I live in Sweden and divide my time between the city, the family farm and the wilderness.

This blog will mostly contain posts about various tech-problems I run into.

My main tech-stack consists of golang, Terraform and typescript with an interest into Open Telemetry.
