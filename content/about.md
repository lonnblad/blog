# Hi there

My name is Fredrik and this is my blog. I work in Software Development and spend most of time either behind the monitor or in the woods.

I live in Sweden and Colombia and divide my time between the city, the family farm and the wilderness.

This blog will mostly contain posts about various tech-problems I run into, where I couldn't find a good post that solves it. Also the occassionaly post about working remotely and life in Colombia as a Swede.

My main languages are golang, HCL for Terraform and typescript
